# About

This vendure plugin adds product recommendations, namely cross- and upselling, to the products. It's up to your frontend to fetch them, a graphql API is provided.

# Disclaimers

This repo just contains a copy of the plugin I'm using for my projects but if you're interested in adding features you are of course welcome to create pull requests.
- There are no tests yet. If you plan to use this plugin in production, you're welcome to create pull requests.
